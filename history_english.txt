Arulmiku Vandavarasi Amman Moolakoil is located in Nellikuppam Village, Thiruporur Circle, Kanchipuram District. The elaborate Panchaloka Utsavar idol was worshiped in this temple without the Moolavar idol.It is special that all the ornaments of this goddess were in the form of a snake. Thousands of devotees not only from that village but also from different parts of Tamil Nadu came to the temple to worship and pay fine for the fulfillment of their Pradatha. People from the laundry community who worshiped this Masakthi as their ancestral deity settled in Eastern Tambaram. Mr. Narasimhan, a member of that community, worshiped an idol of the Goddess made of clay under a huge banyan tree on Thiruvalluvar street in East Tambaram. As their wishes were fulfilled by this puja, the people of the region started worshiping this idol as devotees of this power, and with time they started celebrating the ceremony of pouring pavkatti pulp to the goddess in the month of Adi. After a few years, a small shed was built and converted into a temple.

The number of devotees increased day by day as this goddess gave blessings to the aspirants, and the Adi Thiru Vijha year was celebrated very well and with much respect. Shri Chandraswami, who worshiped this Nagashakti, instructed through his divine power to set up a black stone moolavar vikram and conduct kumbabhishekam. He also introduced many funders for it. Then, with his guidance, he took the blessed sculptor Mr. Perumal Raju from Thayoor village near Thiruvakara, Villupuram district to Nellikuppam temple, the temple of the auspicious Vandavarasi Amman, and made him worship the artistic Panchaloka Vandavarasi Amman Utsavar Vikram there hence, Tavathru Thiruvakarai Chandraswami and the sculptor Mr. Perumal Raju are credited with drawing the same image of the goddess on paper and carving it in black stone. Later, the temple was erected and the statue of Goddess Vandavarasi was consecrated and according to the Vedic Shastra, Tavathru Thiruvakarai Chandraswami led the Thirukkudamudukku ceremony.  In this temple, which was held only on the 4th week of Adi month, Aadithru festival was held, after Kumbabishekam, 108 Palkuda abishekam on Chitra Pelarnami, 108 Sangabishekam on Thaipusath, Tamil New Year festival, Pongal festival, Prati month Pelarnami, Amavasai special abishekam, Navaratri decoration festival and thousands of such special ceremonies were held. Devotees Attended and received Mother's grace, then the idol of Utsavar with the well-known carvings made of Panchaloka was cast in the art gallery of Bandur village near Thirukkalugunram, three Dinars were recited by the Vedas and Homers were performed according to the Shastra methods. While the number of devotees was increasing day by day and various spiritual programs were being held continuously, after 10 years the temple was planned to be built according to the Agamavidhis and the temple was constructed by Sthapathi Mahendran of Coovathur and a grand consecration ceremony was held by Vathru Thiruvakarai Chandraswami. 

Due to the efforts of thousands of devotees who have prayed to this Shakti and their prayers have been fulfilled, the glory of this Shakti can be seen from the fact that the number of devotees who worship the goddess every day with contentment is increasing and the number of devotees who go to worship the goddess with satisfaction is now being made.
